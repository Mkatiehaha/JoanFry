<h2><b><cite>How to Cook a Tapir</cite>: What It’s About</b></h2> 
<p>My third book was <cite>How to Cook a Tapir: A Memoir of Belize</cite> (University of Nebraska Press, 2009). I had tried to write about my experience of living in the rainforest twice, first as nonfiction, but I was still too close to it. Then I tried to fictionalize it, and even I knew it wasn’t working—it wasn’t my story anymore. It was the characters’ story. With the encouragement of Pamela Malpas, who had agreed to represent Backyard Horsekeeping, I was finally able to put my story into context with the rest of my life. A paperback edition came out in 2012.</p>
<p>When I was a sophomore at the University of Michigan, I married an anthropologist and went off on an extended honeymoon to British Honduras, now Belize. I was twenty years old and had very few kitchen skills. My husband and I lived in a bush house in Rio Blanco—no electricity, no plumbing. While he did fieldwork in Belize and neighboring Guatemala, I held down two jobs. Ironically, one of them supported us—the Bishop of British Honduras had hired me, a non-Catholic, to teach the Kekchi and Mopan Maya children their 3 Rs—reading, writing, and ‘rithmetic. My second job was harder. I did know how to boil water. I just didn’t know what to add that would turn it into a meal when cooked over an open fire.</p>  
<h2><b>According to the Critics</b></h2>
<p>How to <cite>Cook a Tapir</cite> was honored with a “Best Book” award from Gourmand, the international food and wine society.</p>
<p>“Back in 1962, Joan Fry, an English major, was hungry for adventure. She married an anthropologist and followed him to what is now Belize, to a village deep in the rain forest for which nothing in her suburban New Jersey upbringing prepared her. She quickly learned that cooking was a survival skill, and her repertoire grew to include tamales (with or without chicken feet), green corn dumplings, gibnut (something like guinea pig) gumbo and homemade beer, or chicha (using corn and fermented sugar cane juice).</p>
<p>“Fry taught English to the local kids, who spoke Mayan dialects—Kekchi and Mopan. She developed a more intimate understanding of their way of life than her husband did. Fry grew up and out of her marriage (on her 21st birthday, she walked 20 miles for company because he was in the field). By the time she returned to his academic life in Ann Arbor, Mich., Fry was better suited for the independence she had found in the rain forest. A mature voice, almost 50 years later, marvels at her younger self.”—Susan Salter Reynolds, Los Angeles Times</p>
