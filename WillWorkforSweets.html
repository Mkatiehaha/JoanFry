<p>Few things are as frustrating as the horse who doesn’t want to be caught. You walk through the gate, halter and lead rope in your hand, ready to ride. Your horse ignores you. You walk closer. He turns and walks away from you. By the time you catch him, he’s still  uncooperative and you’re in no mood to tolerate it. Can you sweet-talk him into at least  pretending he’s glad to see you? Doubtful. Horses can’t pretend anything—and that’s one of their most endearing traits.</p>
<p>Animal behavioralists have only recently begun to study how horses learn, and how they try to communicate with humans. If you’re observant, you can catch your horse trying to tell you all sorts of things. I once owned a Quarter Horse gelding. Before I fed, I’d go up to him to say hello and rub his face. As soon as I started to back away from him, he would turn around, presenting me with his rump. His ears weren’t pinned back (almost always indicates hostility), and he wasn’t cocking a hind leg (can indicate he’s getting ready to kick). Gunsmoke was trying to tell me that in addition to the face rub, he wanted his butt  scratched.</p> 
<p>Boo, my Morgan mare—who for a long time would ignore me unless it was feeding time—did something similar one day. She’s a very fast, methodical eating machine. As soon as there’s hay in her feeder, she’ll stand in the same position until she’s consumed the entire flake.  After that she’ll go for a drink of water. To slow her down, I had just bought her a hay net. In the wild horses graze all day long, a little here, a little there. But domestic hoses, unless they’re pastured, live in small enclosures—a stall, a pipe corral—by themselves, even though there may be other horses nearby. For a while Boo lived alone, and after she finished breakfast, all she had to look forward to was lunch. A bored, curious horse can get in trouble. And Boo did—the day she figured out how to undo the latch on the pipe corral gate. By the time I went to feed her lunch, she was standing next to the chicken coop, her head buried in the metal trashcan full of laying mash. I walked her back to her corral and chained the gate closed. Time to try the new hay net. It had very small mesh, so she could only grab a small mouthful at a time. I put a flake of hay in it and tied it beside her feeder.</p> 
<p>I decided to hang out for a while and see what she did next, so I began pruning dead branches out of the California pepper trees we had growing between the pipe corral and the riding ring. The trees and I were at the far end of her corral. Boo and her hay were on  the other. She had her rump to me, impatiently trying to yank as much hay as possible out of the net. She nosed it back and forth, but only a small amount of hay fell out. Then she grabbed it in her teeth and swung it back and forth. When that didn’t work either, she swung it up and down—so forcefully that she flipped the net and its contents over the fence, completely out of reach.</p> 
<p>I watched as she pivoted and marched straight towards me, ears pinned, glaring at me. This was one seriously pissed-off mare, and she was telling me “I am not amused. Do something!” Obediently I moved away from the pepper trees, trotted over to her hay net, and flipped it  back over the fence. She dove for the hay. I went back to pruning.</p> 
<p>If this is a new horse for you, call his previous owner and ask if the horse actively moved away from her the same way. She may or may not tell you. If she does, find out how she tried to fix the problem. Pay close attention, because whatever she did clearly didn’t work.</p>  
<p>Next, ask yourself why your horse doesn’t want to be caught—and be honest. Does he associate it with something that happens after he’s caught? Such as, are you grooming him too vigorously with a metal curry? Does his saddle rub him the wrong way and pinch? How about the bridle—is it too small? Don’t forget the hardware in his mouth—maybe the bit doesn’t fit correctly. If the horse moves away when you try to mount, he’s probably not looking forward to having you on his back. Have you spent the last four days riding around and around in circles while you practice your sitting trot?</p>  
<p>I had to board Boo once my husband and I packing to leave California and move to Colorado. Her new digs were a pipe corral. She had a neighbor several yards away, a Thoroughbred gelding. They fell in love—or at least she did. When I drove up the next morning to see how she was getting along, she ignored me. As usual. She was too busy flirting.</p> 
<p>But I had a plan, and it involved the striped peppermint candies you can buy at the grocery store around Christmas time. I kept my eyes on Boo—who was still ignoring me—and whistled. You can use a voice commend you’ll remember (like “come”). But I like the whistle because it’s unique. Normally people don’t train horses with a whistle. I walked closer, whistled again, and held out my hand. Boo caught a whiff of peppermint and looked at me over her shoulder. As soon as she saw my outstretched hand, she nickered and trotted up to me. When she did, I gave her the mint and rubbed her face. Because I had  been paying attention to her behavior, I was pretty sure she would do anything for food. That’s how easy it is to teach your horse to come when you call him. Just—whistle.</p>
