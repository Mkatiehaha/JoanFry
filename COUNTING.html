	<h1>COUNTING</h1>
	<h2>Joan Fry</h2>

<img src="images/IMG_2611Resized.jpg" class="noCaption">	
<p>Whenever I drive on the freeway I see dead animals.  Sometimes they've already been shunted aside, stiff with blood.  Even worse are the unrecognizable shapes huddled in the path of on-coming traffic.  I hold my breath, fighting panic, trying desperately to make them into rags, shreds of tire, anything but what they are.</p>  	

<br /><p>I can't not look.  But it's not worth the agony anymore, either of trying to deny what I see or admitting the truth.  I've stopped taking freeways.  I can't stand any more dead things.</p>


<p>"How about Thursday?"  Eliot has called me in the teachers' lounge during my prep period.  I'm surprised he remembers when it is, but numbers are second nature to him.  Of course he'd remember.</p>
<p>"Thursday's good," I answer.</p>
<p>"Can we have dinner first?  Will you cook?"</p>
<p>His request catches me off-balance, and my stomach lurches.  I know I should say no, but I can't.  Maybe by some eleventh-hour miracle we can still work things out.  "If you want to," I answer, trying to match the flirtatiousness in his voice. "If you'll do the dishes."</p>
<p>I tell myself it's a chance I have to take, because otherwise, when dinner is over, Eliot and I will sit down and divide up the remains of a five-year marriage.  Then we'll kiss goodbye and I'll go home to my new apartment, driving slowly, taking surface streets.  I'm hoping that Eliot has asked me to dinner so that he can ask me something else: to come back.</p>
<br /><p>Not since the day we met have I been able to say no to him.</p> 


<p>"What's a stock broker doing with the name of a poet?" I asked, clutching my hands in my lap.  Eliot's nearness on the other side of the desk terrified me; I couldn't take my eyes off him.  He was suggesting "investment strategies" for the small inheritance my father had left me, but I barely listened, even though the money was my father's last, grudging legacy.</p> 
<p>I was thirty-six years old, a high school English teacher wearing sensible, low-heeled shoes.  Eliot was wearing a diamond on his little finger and tinted glasses that gave his eyes a bruised look.  His hair was blond, but his beard would grow in dark, I thought, because when he laughed, his jawline was silver-gray, metallic as a gun glinting.  He ought to be wearing a brocaded vest and a gold watch chain--he looked like a riverboat gambler.  Someone fascinating and dangerous and beyond my reach. </p> 	

<p>Eliot admitted he didn't read much.  "I'm a college dropout who's a genius with figures, if you want to know the truth."  He grinned disarmingly, then cleared his throat.  "Now that you know the worst, would you have lunch with me?"</p>  
<p>The restaurant wasn't anyplace I would have chosen by my-self, an old-fashioned bar and grill with candles burning in hobnail glasses on the table and curved booths shaped like horse-shoes.  Eliot called the waitress "honey" and ordered drinks for both of us.  After that he didn't stop talking.  He was a born story-teller--engaging, guileless, and so eager to tell me about himself that all I had to do was listen.</p>   
<p>He was on his fourth whiskey and soda, sweat curling his hair into ringlets, when he blurted out, "You're more woman than I'm used to.  You're educated and used to doing your own thing.  It would be hard to hold on to you."</p>  
<p>His words registered not through my ears but throughout my entire body, with a spasm like muscle tearing away from bone.  I'd never dared to imagine a self like the one he had just described, a woman smiling and at ease and not afraid of anything, not even the sneering tough guys in her classroom.</p>  	
 
<p>I leaned toward him.  I wanted to be that woman he had just described.  I wanted so much to smooth the sweaty, dark-blond curls off his face and ask him: do you sweat like that in bed? The question obsessed me long after lunch was over.  In the privacy of my mind I poured my heart out to Eliot, confessing things I never dreamed I would tell anyone: my mother's abrupt departure from us, my love of animals and the seacoast, how badly I had wanted to write poetry--and my father's scorn at such a useless ‘female’ occupation.  But even as I talked to Eliot, I knew that if he had been a student of mine, I would have despaired of him.  In fourteen years I'd only had a few like him--bright, bored, amiable boys who loved to find a double meaning in whatever I said and then protest innocence; who always did their homework, but in pencil, adorned with gang graffiti; who would spend hours figuring out how to circumvent a final project that would have taken them 20 minutes.  The careless ones, foredoomed to failure.</p> 	
<br /><p><u>Love me</u>, I prayed in anguish, imagining the gunmetal blue of Eliot's jaw as he laughed.  <u>I can save you if you love me.</u></p> 
  
<p>The apartment feels strange to me, as if I'd never lived here, until I figure out why:  Eliot has hired somebody to come in and clean, and the bathroom has the same impersonal, antiseptic smell Las Vegas pools do. For dinner I fix artichokes, baked potatoes, and two small fillets.  I've cooked more imaginative dinners, but I'm thinking about Eliot, that it will be an easy meal for him to clean up after.</p>  
<p>When we're finished eating, he takes me by the hand and leads me to the bedroom.</p>    	<p> He likes to talk after we've made love, when he's relaxed.  I don't want to make love to him--I don't want to stand naked in front of him again.  But I know that if this is the end, making love will be the real goodbye--not the one we say at the front door when we whisper, "Take care of yourself."</p> 
<p>The bedroom is strewn with boxes, piles of clothes, empty drawers.  It's a small apartment, with one bedroom and cheap carpeting--too small for what we had.  Most of what's left is mine; all I took with me was the clothes in the closet and my bankbook.</p>   	
 
<p>From one wall my father looks down on us with a scowl, as though he's having second thoughts about something--perhaps only about being photographed.  On the other wall is a picture of me and Molly.  Eliot bought her for me as a wedding present.  When I told him I was naming her Molly Bloom, after Joyce's character in Ulysses, he kissed me. "I can't believe I'm marrying a woman who would name her dog after a character in a book," he teased.  He took the photo one Sunday while we were eating breakfast outside.  We had rented a house surrounded by so many oak trees it felt like living in the woods, very secluded, as though we were runaway children playing in a tree house.  I was in my bathrobe, trying to get Molly to shake hands for a piece of toast while she gazed adoringly into my face.  Her blonde head was haloed in sunlight; mine was in shadow, so fuzzy I seemed to have no face at all.</p> 
<p>In bed I feel sick and bloated, like I've eaten too much.  Eliot doesn't seem to notice.  I hold him in my arms, thinking that I know his body better than I know my own, unable to stop looking over his shoulder at the photograph of me and Molly.  I don't have any photographs of Eliot that I like.  Photographs never catch how handsome he is, or his playfulness, or the darkness that surrounds him even now, as I hold him.</p>  
<p>I was so sure it was going to last.  <u>Take a chance on me, baby,</u> he said the night he proposed, his words as stark and unadorned as the diamond he had slipped on my finger.  <u>You might like loving me</u>.  I had never dreamed anyone would want me that much, would call me <u>baby.</u></p>  
<br /><p>I concentrate on the photograph, feeling Eliot's body grow slippery with sweat as he thrusts deeper and deeper inside me.  But even though I stare at it so long my eyes begin to burn, Eliot's not in it.</p>    


 

The Friday after we had lunch, Eliot called and asked me if I wanted to go to Las Vegas.  He liked to play twenty-one, he said; would I like to go with him?</p>  
<p>After that we went every weekend--Vegas, Reno, Lake Tahoe.  He preferred Las Vegas because he said he wasn't as obvious there, even though some of the casinos had eight decks in a shoe and that made it harder.  Eliot counted cards.  He said it gave him a two to three percent advantage over the house a third of the time.  He said that it might take a while, but if he played consistently he'd make money.  Then, once he got a big-enough bankroll, we could fly to Atlantic City, or take a cruise--gambling was legal outside the twelve-mile limit--even go to Monte Carlo.  I was enthralled at how easily he moved in that world, how grave and unobtrusive his voice got, how insistent he was on certain niceties, like tipping three and four times to get a good table for the lounge show</p>.
<p>One afternoon I told him I couldn't go, I had papers to grade.  I told him I'd meet him in the casino afterwards.</p> 
<p>That's not a good idea, he said.  I never know how long I'll be.  Why don't you just lie by the pool when you're done, or go downtown and shop?  Buy yourself something pretty for tonight, when I get back.</p>  
<p>I told him all right, even though the stores all stocked the same clothes and the pool had a harsh, antiseptic smell that had nothing to do with human intimacy.</p>   
 
<p>Eliot didn't come back until two in the morning.  I was still awake, dressed for dinner.  "Please, can we go to Santa Barbara next weekend?" I begged as soon as he came in.  "Molly's never seen the ocean.  Can't you picture her with a flock of seagulls?  We could take a picnic lunch and a frisbee and just let her run and run and run."</p> 
 	<p>Eliot sat down on the bed, his back to me.  "I lost a lot of money tonight.  I'm used to having you with me, and when you're not there I can't concentrate."  He started undressing, still without facing me. "I told you you'd get tired of me."</p>   	
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"I don't blame you for not wanting to come anymore.  There's nothing for you to do."</p>  
<p>"Stop it!"  I grabbed him, pressing against him as if I were using my body to stop a wound from bleeding.  "There are lots of things I can do!"</p> 
<p>Eliot shook his head, implacable.  "You'll leave me someday.  You'll find somebody you can talk to about books, some poet."</p>
<p>"Teach me twenty-one, so I can sit next to you and pretend I'm just some silly tourist betting nickels and dimes, but I'll really be helping you."</p>
<p>"You can't.  They'd bust us."</p>
<p>"Help you by being there.  And afterwards we can go out to dinner and laugh about how we fooled them."</p> 
<p>I could feel the heat from Eliot's body through his shirt and smell the whiskey sweetness of his breath.  "You're not a gambler, baby.  You're too smart."</p> 
<p>"I gambled on you."</p>  
<p>At that he turned around.</p>  
<p>"Do we have to do this <u>every</u> weekend?  Is a hobby that important to you?"</p>
 
 	<p>"It's not a hobby, baby.  I quit my job last week.  This is how I put food on the table from now on--this is my job.  I should have known you'd get bored.  You'll get bored with me, too, one of these days."</p> 
<p>"<u>Stop it</u>!"  In a passion of remorse I snatched off his tinted glasses to kiss his eyes, his nose, his ear, his throat, closing in on his mouth.  "I'm--not--bored," I said fiercely between kisses.  "<u>You</u>--are--crazy."</p>   
<p>Eliot's face was half-hidden from me, like Molly's when she knew we were leaving and she had to stay behind.  But he didn't try to stop me.  "No I'm not.  I'm in love."</p>  
<p>We undressed each other in a frenzy that was like the first time we had made love, when we hardly dared to touch each other because our need was so close to the surface we were certain our skins would ignite.</p>
<p>"What do you want me to do?" Eliot whispered.  He wasn't much taller than I was; looking at him when he had his glasses off was like looking into a mirror.  I could see my face more clearly than when I gazed at the photograph of the woman in the bathrobe asking Molly to shake hands.  "Tell me. I want to make you come five times a night. I want to make you happy."</p>
<p>Touch me here, and here, and here, I whispered back, clinging to him, my body so slippery with his sweat I could no longer distinguish between us.</p> 
<br /><p>We'll go to Santa Barbara some other time, I told Molly when we got home.  You'll see the ocean.  I promise you.</p>


 
<p>After we make love in the sad disarray of our bedroom,  Eliot fixes another drink and I walk back to the livingroom.  Nothing has been said.  All that's left is to split up our belongings.  Some things, like the antique furniture my father left me, I had to sell when the rent came due, or the car insurance.  Eliot wasn't as successful as he thought he'd be. I was so frightened at the amount of money I saw slipping through his fingers that whenever we left for Las Vegas I broke out in hives.  I was so nervous Eliot said I made him nervous; he finally agreed I'd be better off at home.</p> 
<p><u>You don't have the stomach for this</u>, he told me kindly. <u>Sometimes you have to lose for a long time before it turns around</u>.</p> 
<p>Even now I would give anything to hear him say that again, hear him say it over and over and over until I believe him.</p>  	
<p>"I'd like the end tables."</p> 
<p>Eliot frowns.  "Why can't we split them up?"</p>  
<p>"What good is one end table?"</p>  	
<p>"Can't we each have one table, one chair, and one sofa?" 	
<p>"That's fine, except why don't you take the two lamps and I'll take the two end tables?"</p> 
<p>"Then I want the coffee table."</p> 
<p>"If I can have the glass sideboard."</p> 
<p>Eliot takes a sip of his drink. "Okay."</p>   
<br /><p>We move on to the kitchen.</p>

 
<p>My period was two months late, but I'd put off saying anything to Eliot; I kept telling myself I'd figured wrong.  We had moved to a smaller apartment that had a tiny fenced yard for Molly.  We told each other we weren't here that much, and at least we could park the car in the yard--which was safer than leaving it on the street--as long as we remembered to close the gate. I was still teaching five days a week, when Eliot was in Las Vegas, and when he came home on the weekend there just wasn't time for anything else, not other people or writing letters to friends or calculating when my period was due.</p> 
 	<p>Finally Eliot asked why I wasn't drinking coffee anymore. "It makes me sick," I admitted.</p> 
<p>"You're not pregnant, are you?"
<p>"I don't know," I hedged, trying to read his reaction.  If he didn't want a baby, I didn't either.  "What do you think we should do?"</p>
<p>"Aren't we a little old to be parents?  I don't think I'd have the patience, would you?  Would you take it to Vegas with us?"</p>
<p>The more he talked, the more far-fetched it seemed, the two of us with a baby.  "Of course not," I said.  "What would I do with a kid in a gambling casino?"</p>  
<p>But nobody mentioned the word abortion, and nobody called for an appointment.  That would be up to me, I thought, and then I started to bleed.  Nothing dramatic, I didn't even have cramps, but it wouldn't stop.  Finally I called a clinic that was open evenings.  Eliot said he'd take me, but he didn't want to hang around pregnant women all night.  Of course not, I told him.  I'll call you when I'm through.</p> 
<p>"You miscarried," said the doctor.  "I can give you a hormone injection to stop the bleeding, but if you're trying to get pregnant that's not the route to take.  Are you trying to get pregnant?"</p>  
 
<p>He was so matter-of-fact; he probably asked the same question a dozen times a week.</p>  
<p>"I don't know," I said.  "Let me talk to my husband."  It wasn't what I expected to say but it had all been too fast.  Maybe I was pregnant.  Maybe Eliot wanted it, if I'd take care of it.  But now I wasn't.  What did I want?</p>   
<p>I called Eliot but there was no answer, so I waited outside.  I didn't feel like hanging around pregnant women all night either.</p> 
<p>Maybe he decided to just drive around instead of going back home, I thought.  But he didn't come.  I was too embarrassed to go back inside the clinic so I crossed the street to a gas station and called again from there.  Still no answer.</p>  	
<p>Around nine all the nurses came out in a group.  One asked if I needed a ride, but I shook my head.  It had been dark for hours, and I was trying not to panic.  He wouldn't leave me like this, I thought.  He'd tell me first--he wouldn't just not show up.  Then I thought, something's happened to him.  I'd had a dream once about three men in a black Cadillac pulling up to the curb in front of our apartment.  The Cadillac's windows were tinted, and the men all wore dark suits.  They were looking for Eliot.  When I told him about it, he laughed.  "It won't happen, baby.  You worry too much."</p>
<p>I was nearly crying.  I wasn't pregnant and I had married a man who kept a loaded gun in his suitcase and who told me my dreams didn't mean anything.  Maybe he was already dead.</p> 
 
<br /><p>Then I saw Eliot.  He was walking towards me very slowly, as though afraid I might run away.  Oh baby, he said over and over.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I just had a couple of drinks and I  fell asleep watching the Raiders game on TV.  I'd bet the Broncos to beat the spread and I wanted to see who won, but I fell asleep.  That's why I never heard the phone.  I didn't mean it, you know that.  You're my whole life.  You know I'd never leave you.</p>

<p>"How about the bed?"</p>
<p>"You might as well take it," I tell him.  "I bought one when I moved into the apartment."</p> 
<p>"And the bureau?"</p>
<p>"I'd sort of like that.  You can have the night stands."</p>
<p>"I'd rather have the bureau."</p>
<p>I look around to see what I can trade for the nightstands and see the photograph of my father.  "I don't think you'll fight me for this," <p>I say, taking it off the wall.</p> 
<p>Eliot looks at me reproachfully.  "I'm not going to fight you for anything.  But I'd like the picture of you and Molly."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
 	<p>"But I don't have one of the two of you."
"You have that box of photos.  Take one of me and one of her and put them next to each other."</p>
<p>"Hey, wait a minute.  Let's not start a war."</p> 
<p>I'm probably even more surprised than Eliot at the vehemence in my voice.  "Keep the damn bureau.  I'm taking the picture."</p>  
<p>"What's going on here?  That picture belongs to me, if you think about it.  I was the one that took it and had it blown up for your birthday and bought the frame for it."</p> 
 
<p>"Take the bureau <u>and</u> the night stands.  It's my picture."</p>  
<p>"I don't believe you!"  Eliot picks up his drink and stands with it in his hand as though to steady himself.  "All this is about me leaving the gate open when I went to Vegas, isn't it."</p>
<p>"No," I say automatically, the way I've always done.  <u>No, I'm not mad at you.  No sweetheart, it's not your fault</u>.  Then I look at the picture, the sunlight around Molly's blonde head. "Yes.  And about you being in such a hurry you never even noticed she'd gotten out, didn't even see her--"</p> 
<p>"Hey, come on.  You could have looked out the window too."</p> 
<p>"--didn't even see her running after you.  The only thing on your mind was getting on the freeway before I discovered the $2,000 check you'd written yourself."</p> 
<p>Eliot takes a quick sip of his drink. "How was I supposed to know she'd follow me?  If you'd come out to kiss me goodbye, like you used to, it wouldn't have happened.  You would have seen her."</p>   
<p>I don't answer.  There's nothing to say except that I did see her, but not until three days later, and by that time animal control had picked her up off the freeway and she was dead. 	I tell Eliot I'll come get the furniture this weekend, when I can borrow a pickup truck.  He asks if I can do it earlier, he's put a deposit on an apartment in Vegas and he wants to be out by this weekend.  I tell him I'll do what I can.  Then I leave.  I simply close the door behind me and walk to my car holding Molly's picture.</p> 
 
<p><u>I can drive to Santa Barbara tonight if I want to</u>, I think. <u>Right now.</u>  I feel like going somewhere very fast, running down the beach shedding my clothes and plunging naked into the ocean--some action that will un-marry me from Eliot.  Even though it's nearly midnight and there isn't another car in sight, I stop at the stop sign on the corner.  As I make the turn, a car coming from the other direction flashes his brights at me.</p>   		
<p><u>Pervert</u>, I think.  <u>Go play games with somebody else</u>.  Then he does it again: I haven't turned my headlights on.  I wave my thanks, but he's already past.  Suddenly I realize I'm driving down the freeway onramp.</p> 
 <p>I'm so terrified that I consider stopping and backing up. Ahead of me the curve of an adjoining freeway shines in the darkness, tier after tier of lights, headlights merging into tail lights in one continuous stream.</p>  
 <p>And then I'm one of them.  To my surprise I feel weightless, adrift in lights--like a star, or a Roman candle bursting across the sky, one of many, all our solitary souls lit up and briefly shining.  I will drive to Santa Barbara.  I will run into the chilly, cleansing sea and--naked--start to swim.</p> 
<p>And "I love you," I whisper.</p> 
<p>I have no idea who I'm talking to.</p>
