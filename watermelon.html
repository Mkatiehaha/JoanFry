		<h1>A Watermelon Moment</h1>
		<h2>Joan Fry</h2>
		<p>A couple of days ago I went grocery shopping. The customer before me looked to be about my age, and when he saw all the fruits and veggies I was buying, he turned to me and pointed at the watermelon.</p> 
		<p>“Your horse will love that,” he said. “Just be prepared for slobber up to your elbows.”</p>  
		<p>Because it was the oddest pickup line I’ve ever heard, I played along, and told him that Boo would eat almost anything—with the possible exception of paste wormer.</p> 
		<p>“I had a big Paint once who would not take any medicine at all,” he told me. “I could put it in sweet feed and he’d eat all around it, even worm medicine or any kind of pill, no matter how little it was.”</p> 
		<p>“Did you try applesauce?” I asked. “That usually works for me.”</p> 
		<p>“Not this horse. Finally got myself a balling gun and gave it to him that way. Watermelon  has some kind of chemical in it that’s good for them, but it does make a mess.”</p> 
		<p>Wait—shoving a metal balling gun, also known as a bolus gun, down a horse’s throat to administer a wormer? And how big were these “little” pills?  If you’re going to use a balling gun, you better have a big pill—plus a tutorial from your veterinarian about it works. And what about this “chemical”? But I kept my reservations to myself. “All my horses have loved fruit,” I told him. “Apples, carrots, sugar cubes, anything sweet. I had a horse once that loved raisins.”</p>  
		<p>I thought about telling him about Daisy, a pretty little palomino mare owned by a friend of mine, who was my horse’s temporary roommate. My (ex) husband and I were moving to New Hampshire, so we had a realtor who popped up from time to time with prospective buyers. I knew I wouldn’t miss the house, but I would miss the orchard, which included a pomegranate tree. One afternoon when the  realtor showed up, both horses were hanging their heads over the fence just in case anybody felt like petting them or—better yet—had a treat for them. Daisy, I saw, had already eaten her treat—right off the pomegranate tree. With her four white stockings and pretty face she looked like a prom queen, wearing a palomino-colored dress and bright red lipstick. Then the realtor turned her back on the horses—and me—to show the buyers something else. She was wearing a white pants suit. Or she had been. The back of her jacket was liberally spattered and slobbered-on with pomegranate juice.</p>  
		<p>But the story was too long to tell, and the watermelon man had picked up his purchases and looked ready to leave. On impulse I asked him, “How did you know I have a horse?” I was wondering if maybe he recognized me from the photo that runs with these columns.</p>  
		<p>He turned back to me, looking thoughtful, and then said, “All good people have horses.”</p> 
		<p>Not bad for a quick answer to a loaded question. It was certainly creative, and, in an old-fashioned way, charming. Maybe if I were single—or maybe not.</p>  
		<p>I digress. According to the Mayo Clinic, watermelon is more than a sweet treat. It has “more lycopene than any other fresh fruit or vegetable.” Lycopene is an antioxidant (the mystery “chemical”?) linked to decreased risk of cancer, heart disease and age-related eye disorders.” It has fewer calories than most other fruits, contain Vitamin B6, necessary for nerve function, and it boosts the immune system. It’s rich in Vitamin C, which also boosts the immune system, and potassium, which lowers blood pressure and also helps nerve function.</p>  
		<p>But is it safe for horses? Yes, for the same reasons it’s beneficial to humans. And because you feed your horse the rind, cut into ice cube-sized pieces, he gets plenty of fiber in addition to water. Buy a melon that’s yellow, not white, on one side—that means it’s ripe and will be very red inside. The brighter the color, the more nutrition it packs. Just make sure to wash the colorful  skin before you cut it, to get rid of any lingering pesticide before you feed it to your horse. And yes—there will be slobber.</p>
